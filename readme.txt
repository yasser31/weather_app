this app uses the open weather api to get weather data and displays them with tkinter

we use the tkintermapview library to create a map on the tkinter window to select the city that we want to forcast

to use the app please create a virutal environment and install the dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt


finally run the file weather_app.py the window should appear and it will be set at the your location using your Ip address

To use the application you need to have an open weather API Key
